## Figure 1. Single-cell RNA-seq landscape reveals cellular heterogeneity in triple-negative breast cancer.

(A) UMAP visualization of 84,837 cells from 19 samples after quality control and batch correction. Cells are colored by sample ID (left), condition (Normal vs TNBC, middle), and cluster assignment (right). (B) Dot plot showing expression patterns of canonical marker genes across 11 cell clusters. Dot size represents the percentage of cells expressing each gene; color intensity indicates average expression level. (C) UMAP plot annotated with 11 identified cell types: Epithelial (cluster 0), T cells (cluster 1), Proliferating Epithelial (cluster 2), Macrophages (cluster 3), Fibroblasts (cluster 4), Basal (cluster 5), Endothelial (cluster 6), Luminal Epithelial (cluster 7), Plasma cells (cluster 8), Pericytes (cluster 9), and B cells (cluster 10). (D) Stacked bar chart displaying the proportion of each cell type in Normal and TNBC tissues. TNBC tumors exhibit increased infiltration of immune cells, including B cells, T cells, and Macrophages. (E) Volcano plots showing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between TNBC and Normal samples for each cell type. Top 10 genes with the largest fold changes are labeled. Red dots indicate genes with adjusted p-value < 0.01; black dots indicate non-significant genes. Key T cell DEGs include IGLV1, TRBV20-1, and ATP5E, which are significantly upregulated in TNBC.

## Figure 2. Cell-cell communication analysis reveals enhanced T cell signaling in TNBC microenvironment.

(A-B) Chord diagrams comparing the differential number (A) and strength (B) of intercellular interactions between Normal and TNBC samples. Red edges indicate increased signaling in TNBC; blue edges indicate decreased signaling. T cells, B cells, and Macrophages show increased interaction with other cell types in TNBC. (C-D) Network diagrams depicting the number of interactions between cell types in Normal (C) and TNBC (D) samples. (E) Stacked bar chart showing the relative information flow of each signaling pathway. Vertical dashed line indicates 50% of total information flow. The analysis identified 87 pathways total: 12 Normal-specific, 31 TNBC-specific, and 44 shared pathways. (F-G) Scatter plots showing the dominant senders and receivers in two-dimensional space for Normal (F) and TNBC (G) samples. Bubble size represents the number of interactions; axes represent outgoing and incoming interaction strengths. T cells exhibit significantly enhanced incoming signal strength in TNBC. (H) Scatter plot displaying T cell-related signaling changes between Normal and TNBC. MHC-I, MIF-(CD74+CD44), MIF-(CD74+CXCR4), COLLAGEN, APP, and CD99 pathways show unique alterations in TNBC (p < 0.01). (I) Dot heatmap showing significant ligand-receptor pairs from sender cells (Macrophages, Epithelial, Endothelial, Fibroblasts, etc.) to T cells via MIF, CXCL, CCL, and COMPLEMENT pathways in TNBC. Key pairs include MIF-(CD74+CD44), MIF-(CD74+CXCR4), CXCL12-CXCR4, and CXCL10-CXCR3. (J) Dot heatmap displaying significant ligand-receptor pairs from T cells to receiver cells (B cells, Macrophages, Endothelial) via MIF and CCL pathways. Notable pairs include MIF-(CD74+CD44), MIF-(CD74+CXCR4), and CCL5-ACKR1/CCR1. P-values calculated by one-sided permutation test; heatmap color represents communication probability.

## Figure 3. WGCNA analysis identifies ubiquitination-related prognostic genes in TNBC T cells.

(A) Venn diagram showing the intersection of T cell marker genes (3,067 genes) and ubiquitin proteasome-related genes (800 genes), yielding 177 T cell-related ubiquitination genes (TCRUG). (B) Hierarchical clustering dendrogram of TCRUG with module assignment indicated by color bars below. Four co-expression modules were identified: MEblue, MEbrown, MEturquoise, and MEgrey. (C) Module-trait correlation heatmap showing the relationship between gene modules and survival time. The MEturquoise module exhibits the strongest correlation with survival time (correlation = 0.002, p < 0.01). (D) Heatmap displaying expression patterns of MEturquoise module genes in Normal and Tumor samples. Hierarchical clustering reveals distinct expression profiles between conditions. Color scale represents z-scored expression levels (blue: low; red: high). (E) Forest plot showing univariate Cox regression analysis results for 30 genes from the MEturquoise module. All genes displayed significant prognostic value (p < 0.05). Genes include BTBD6, CDC34, FBXL15, FBXL18, FBXL6, GMCL1, HECTD3, HECW1, KCTD17, KLHL17, KRT8, LZTR1, MPND, MUL1, OTUB1, PPIL2, PSMA2, RCBTB1, RNF123, RNF135, RNF185, RNF187, SHKBP1, SHPRH, SPSB1, UBR4, USP2, VPS18, ZBTB7B, and ZBTB7C. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals are shown. (F) Bar chart displaying p-values from Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for 21 prognostically significant genes. P-values are arranged in ascending order. (G) UpSet plot showing the intersection of genes identified through three independent analyses: Kaplan-Meier (KM, 21 genes), Cox regression (COX, 30 genes), and differential expression (DEGs, 59 genes). Thirteen genes were common to all three analyses and selected as key prognostic candidates.

## Figure 4. Construction and validation of a three-gene prognostic risk model for TNBC.

(A-C) Kaplan-Meier survival curves comparing high-risk and low-risk patient groups in TCGA-Train (A), TCGA-Test (B), and GSE25066 (C) cohorts. High-risk patients exhibit significantly poorer overall survival than low-risk patients across all datasets (log-rank test: p < 0.0001 for TCGA-Train, p = 0.00019 for TCGA-Test, p = 0.0023 for GSE25066). Numbers at risk are shown below each plot. (D-F) Risk score distribution, survival status, and gene expression profiles for TCGA-Train (D), TCGA-Test (E), and GSE25066 (F) cohorts. Top panel: scatter plot of survival time vs patients ranked by increasing risk score (circles: alive; triangles: dead). Middle panel: risk score trajectory showing the threshold separating high-risk and low-risk groups (dashed line at risk score = 0). Bottom panel: heatmap displaying expression patterns of the three model genes (GMCL1, KRT8, OTUB1). KRT8 and OTUB1 are upregulated in high-risk patients, while GMCL1 shows opposite expression pattern. Color scale represents z-scored expression (blue: low; red: high).

## Figure 5. Independent validation and clinical nomogram construction for TNBC prognosis prediction.

(A-C) Time-dependent ROC curves evaluating the prognostic accuracy of the three-gene risk score in Train (A), Test (B), and GSE25066 (C) cohorts. AUC values for 2-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival are displayed. TCGA-Train achieves AUC values of 0.67, 0.69, and 0.72, respectively; TCGA-Test achieves 0.53, 0.63, and 0.70; GSE25066 achieves 0.62, 0.63, and 0.59. (D) Forest plot showing univariate Cox regression analysis of clinical variables and risk score. T stage (HR = 1.600, p = 0.004), N stage (HR = 1.340, p = 0.026), and risk score (HR = 6.549, p = 0.007) are significantly associated with prognosis. (E) Forest plot displaying multivariate Cox regression analysis. Risk score remains an independent prognostic factor (HR = 8.881, p = 0.003) after adjusting for T and N stages. (F) Nomogram integrating age, T stage, grade, N stage, and risk score to predict 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival probabilities. Total points range from 100 to 240, with higher scores indicating poorer prognosis. (G) Calibration curves validating the nomogram's predictive performance for 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival. The predicted survival probabilities closely match the observed outcomes, demonstrating robust calibration. (H) ROC curves comparing the prognostic performance of individual clinical factors (Grade, T, N, Risk) and the integrated nomogram. The nomogram achieves the highest AUC (0.719), substantially outperforming individual predictors. (I) Kaplan-Meier survival analysis stratified by nomogram score levels (high vs low). Patients with high nomogram scores have significantly worse overall survival (p = 0.00034). Numbers at risk are shown for both groups at multiple time points.
