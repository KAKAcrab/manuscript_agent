      "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive disease characterized by remarkable intratumor heterogeneity (ITH), which poses therapeutic challenges. However, the clinical relevance and key determinant of ITH in TNBC are poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively characterized ITH levels using multi-omics data across our center's cohort (n = 260), The Cancer Genome Atlas cohort (n = 134), and four immunotherapy-treated cohorts (n = 109). Our results revealed that high ITH was associated with poor patient survival and immunotherapy resistance. Importantly, we identified zinc finger protein 689 (ZNF689) deficiency as a crucial determinant of ITH formation. Mechanistically, the ZNF689-TRIM28 complex was found to directly bind to the promoter of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1), inducing H3K9me3-mediated transcriptional silencing. ZNF689 deficiency reactivated LINE-1 retrotransposition to exacerbate genomic instability, which fostered ITH. Single-cell RNA sequencing, spatially resolved transcriptomics and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that ZNF689 deficiency-induced ITH inhibited antigen presentation and T-cell activation, conferring immunotherapy resistance. Pharmacological inhibition of LINE-1 significantly reduced ITH, enhanced antitumor immunity, and eventually sensitized ZNF689-deficient tumors to immunotherapy in vivo. Consistently, ZNF689 expression positively correlated with favorable prognosis and immunotherapy response in clinical samples. Altogether, our study uncovers a previously unrecognized mechanism underlying ZNF689 deficiency-induced ITH and suggests LINE-1 inhibition combined with immunotherapy as a novel treatment strategy for TNBC.",

      "abstract": "The central challenge in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) immunotherapy is to identify novel mechanism-derived strategies for anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) resistance and efficiently assess their efficacy and safety in humans. Understanding the intricate heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment and its impact on treatment could guide the initiation of proof-of-concept clinical trials. Here, integrating single-cell transcriptome of 44 treatment-naive patients with TNBC, we unveiled an association between intrapatient mast cell heterogeneity and clinical benefit of PD-1 blockade. Upon independent parallel validation in 484 patients with TNBC, high levels of breast tissue antigen-presenting mast cells (apMCs) were associated with enhanced anti-PD-1 efficacy. Mechanistically, apMCs largely located within tertiary lymphoid structures and were efficient in performing presentation and cross-presentation of antigens and expressed co-stimulatory molecules. Conditional deletion of antigen-presenting machinery in mast cells dampened tumor-reactive T cells. A widely prescribed allergy medication, cromolyn, was identified to mobilize apMC-mediated T cell immunity and sensitize tumors to PD-1 blockade. We subsequently initiated a phase 2 clinical trial in female patients with anti-PD-1-refractory metastatic TNBC. Here we report the results of the cromolyn arm (cromolyn plus anti-PD-1 backbone). The prespecified primary endpoint of this arm was met, with a confirmed objective response rate of 50.0%. Our study defines a crucial role of mast cells in cancer immune control, identifies an apMC-directed approach to overcome anti-PD-1 resistance and highlights a reverse-translational framework that offers conceptual advances in precision immuno-oncology with direct implications for clinical therapy.

      "abstract": "The recent discovery of copper-mediated and mitochondrion-dependent cuproptosis has aroused strong interest in harnessing this novel mechanism of cell death for cancer therapy. Here the design of a core-shell nanoparticle, CuP/Er, for the co-delivery of copper (Cu) and erastin (Er) to cancer cells for synergistic cuproptosis and ferroptosis is reported. The anti-Warburg effect of Er sensitizes tumor cells to Cu-mediated cuproptosis, leading to irreparable mitochondrial damage by depleting glutathione and enhancing lipid peroxidation. CuP/Er induces strong immunogenic cell death, enhances antigen presentation, and upregulates programmed death-ligand 1 expression. Consequently, CuP/Er promotes proliferation and infiltration of T cells, and when combined with immune checkpoint blockade, effectively reinvigorates T cells to mediate the regression of murine colon adenocarcinoma and triple-negative breast cancer and prevent tumor metastasis. This study suggests a unique opportunity to synergize cuproptosis and ferroptosis with combination therapy nanoparticles to elicit strong antitumor effects and potentiate current cancer immunotherapies.",

      "abstract": "Despite the success of immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) in treating cancer, patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) often develop resistance to therapy, and the underlying mechanisms are unclear. MHC-I expression is essential for antigen presentation and T-cell-directed immunotherapy responses. This study demonstrates that TNBC patients display intratumor heterogeneity in regional MHC-I expression. In murine models, loss of MHC-I negates antitumor immunity and ICI response, whereas intratumor MHC-I heterogeneity leads to increased infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells in an IFNγ-dependent manner. Using spatial technologies, MHC-I heterogeneity is associated with clinical resistance to anti-programmed death (PD) L1 therapy and increased NK:T-cell ratios in human breast tumors. MHC-I heterogeneous tumors require NKG2A to suppress NK-cell function. Combining anti-NKG2A and anti-PD-L1 therapies restores complete response in heterogeneous MHC-I murine models, dependent on the presence of activated, tumor-infiltrating NK and CD8+ T cells. These results suggest that similar strategies may enhance patient benefit in clinical trials.",
