## Example 1: SARS-CoV-2 Drug Discovery (Nature 2020)

**Paper**: Structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of its inhibitors
**Journal**: Nature
**Type**: Original Research Article

Coronaviruses infect humans and other animals and cause a variety of
highly prevalent and severe diseases, including severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)7. The
SARS-CoV-2 genome comprises about 30,000 nucleotides: the repli-
case gene of SARS-CoV-2 encodes two overlapping polyproteins—pp1a
and pp1ab—that are required for viral replication and transcription3,4.
The functional polypeptides are released from the polyproteins by
extensive proteolytic processing, predominantly by the 33.8-kDa Mpro
(also known as 3C-like protease). Mpro digests the polyprotein at at
least 11 conserved sites, starting with the autolytic cleavage of this
enzyme itself from pp1a and pp1ab8. The functional importance of
Mpro in the viral life cycle, combined with the absence of closely related

homologues in humans, identify Mpro as an attractive target for the
design of antiviral drugs9.

To facilitate the rapid discovery of antiviral compounds with clinical
potential, we developed a strategy that combines structure-assisted
drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening to
repurpose existing drugs to target SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.

Establishing a high-throughput activity assay

by mass spectroscopy is 33797.0 Da, consistent with its theoretical
molecular mass of 33796.8 Da. To characterize the enzymatic activity
of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and to carry out high-throughput screening of
inhibitors, we developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer
assay. To do this, we designed and synthesized the fluorescently labelled
substrate Mca–AVLQ↓SGFRK(Dnp)K, derived from the N-terminal
autocleavage sequence of the viral protease, for time-dependent kinetic
analysis (Extended Data Fig. 1e). The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) for
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was measured to be 28,500 M−1 s−1, which is slightly
higher than that for SARS-CoV Mpro (kcat/Km = 26,500 M−1 s−1)10 and
more than 30-fold higher than that of human rhinovirus 3C protease
(kcat/Km = 920 M−1 s−1)11.

N3 is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro
In a previous study12, a Michael acceptor inhibitor—known as N3—
was developed using computer-aided drug design (Extended Data
Fig. 1c). N3 can specifically inhibit Mpro from multiple coronavi-
ruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV12–15, and has displayed
potent antiviral activity against infectious bronchitis virus in an
animal model13. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration of N3 is >133 μM
(Extended Data Fig. 1f). Next, we constructed a homology model
for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and used molecular docking to see whether
N3 could target this Mpro. A docking pose showed that N3 could fit
inside the substrate-binding pocket. To assess the efficacy of N3 for
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, we performed kinetic analysis. A progress curve
showed that it is a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of this
enzyme. Further, the shape of this curve supports the mechanism of
two-step irreversible inactivation. The inhibitor first associates with
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a dissociation constant Ki, and then a stable
covalent bond is formed between N3 and Mpro. The evaluation of this
time-dependent inhibition requires both the equilibrium-binding
constant (Ki, designated as k2/k1) and the inactivation-rate constant
for covalent bond formation, k3. However, N3 exhibits a very potent
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, such that the measurement of Ki and
k3 was not feasible (Extended Data Fig. 1d, e). When very rapid inac-
tivation occurs, kobs/[I] was used to evaluate the inhibition as an
approximation of the pseudo-second-order rate constant (k3/Ki)12.
We determined the value of kobs/[I] of N3 for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro as
11,300 ± 880 M−1 s−1, which suggests that this Michael acceptor was
markedly inhibited.

Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro–N3
To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of N3, we determined the crystal
structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with N3 to a resolution of 2.1 Å.
The asymmetric unit contains only one polypeptide (Extended Data
Table 1). However, two of these polypeptides (designated protomer
A and B) associate to form a dimer by a crystallographic two-fold axis
of symmetry (Fig. 1b). All of the residues 1–306 are visible in electron
density maps. Each protomer is composed of three domains (Fig. 1a).
Domain I (residues 8–101) and domain II (residues 102–184) have an
antiparallel β-barrel structure. Domain III (residues 201–303) contains
five α-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster, and
it is connected to domain II by a long loop region (residues 185–200).
SARS-CoV-2 Mpro has a Cys-His catalytic dyad, and the substrate-binding
site is located in a cleft between domain I and domain II. These features
are similar to previously reported Mpro from other coronaviruses5,6,13–15.
The electron density map shows that N3 binds in the substrate-binding
pocket in an extended conformation (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 2);
the inhibitor backbone atoms form an antiparallel sheet with resi-
dues 164–168 of the long strand (residues 155–168) on one side, and
with residues 189–191 of the loop that links domain II to domain III on
the other.

Here we detail the specific interactions of N3 with Mpro (Fig. 1c, d). The
electron density shows that the Sγ atom of C145 of protomer A forms a
covalent bond (1.8 Å) with the Cβ atom of the vinyl group, confirming
that the Michael addition has occurred. The S1 subsite has an absolute
requirement for Gln at the P1 position. The side chains of F140, N142,
E166, H163 and H172 of protomer A, and S1 of protomer B—as well as
the main chains of F140 and L141 of protomer A—are involved in the
formation of the S1 subsite, which also includes two ordered water
molecules (which we refer to as W1 and W2). The lactam at P1 inserts
into the S1 subsite and forms a hydrogen bond with H163 of protomer A.
The side chain of Leu at the P2 site inserts deeply into the hydrophobic
S2 subsite, which consists of the side chains of H41, M49, Y54 and M165,
as well as the alkyl portion of the side chain of D187, of protomer A.
The side chain of Val at P3 is solvent-exposed, which indicates that
this site can tolerate a wide range of functional groups. The side chain
of Ala at the P4 side is surrounded by the side chains of M165, L167,
F185, Q192 of protomer A and the main chain of Q189 of protomer A,
which together form a small hydrophobic pocket. P5 makes van der
Waals contacts with P168 of protomer A, and with the backbone of

residues 190–191. The bulky benzyl group extends into the S1′ site,
forming van der Waals interactions with T24 and T25 of protomer A.
N3 forms multiple hydrogen bonds with the main chain of the residues
in the substrate-binding pocket, which also helps to lock the inhibitor
inside the substrate-binding pocket.

An overlay of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with N3
and SARS-CoV Mpro in complex with N1 (ref. 12), an alternative Michael
acceptor inhibitor, shows that N3 and N1 bind to Mpro in a similar mode
(Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 3). The major difference lies in the P1′ site.
Compared with the benzyl ester portion of N3 in the SARS-CoV-2
Mpro–N3 structure, the ethyl ester portion in N1 in SARS-CoV Mpro–N1
adopts a slightly different conformation. This can be attributed to an
ordered water (W1) in the SARS-CoV Mpro–N1 structure, which makes
a long-distance hydrogen bond to the carboxylate oxygen of the ester
and also forms two hydrogen bonds from the backbone NH of G143
and the side chain of N142. A previous study proposed that Mpro has
substrate-recognition pocket that is highly conserved among all coro-
naviruses, and that this pocket could serve as a drug target for the
design of broad-spectrum inhibitors12. The recent discovery of new
coronaviruses, and the accumulation of structural data for Mpro from
coronaviruses of various species, provided the opportunity to further
examine this hypothesis. Superposition of the 12 crystal structures
of Mpro (refs. 12–21) shows that the most variable regions are the helical
domain III and surface loops, and that the substrate-binding pocket
(located in a cleft between domain I and domain II) is highly conserved
among Mpro in all coronaviruses; this suggests that antiviral inhibitors
targeting this pocket should have wide-spectrum activity against coro-
naviruses (Fig. 2b, c).

Virtual screening
The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro in complex with N3 provides a model
for identifying lead inhibitors to target SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using in silico
screening. To achieve this, we docked an in-house database of potential
binding compounds using Glide (v.8.2)22. The results show that cinan-
serin fits snugly into the substrate-binding pocket, through cation–π
interactions with H41 and E166 of Mpro. Subsequently, we determined

this compound has a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value
of 125 μM for Mpro. Moreover, cinanserin is a well-characterized seroto-
nin antagonist, which underwent preliminary clinical testing in humans
in the 1960s23 and has previously been shown to inhibit SARS-CoV Mpro
(ref. 24). The 50% cytotoxicity concentration of cinanserin is >200 μM
(Extended Data Fig. 4); thus, it has potential for optimization as an
antiviral drug lead.

High-throughput screening
Next, we used our fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay to
screen a library of about 10,000 compounds, consisting of approved
drugs, clinical-trial drug candidates and natural products. The primary
hits were seven compounds, including approved drugs (disulfiram
and carmofur) as well as preclinical or clinical-trial drug candidates
(ebselen, shikonin, tideglusib, PX-12 and TDZD-8). We then determined
the IC50 values of these seven compounds, which range from 0.67 to
21.4 μM (Fig. 3). Ebselen has the strongest inhibition of Mpro activity,
with an IC50 of 0.67 μM. Using a previously described detergent-based
assay25, we found that TDZD-8 is an aggregate-based inhibitor that
might nonspecifically inhibit Mpro (Extended Data Fig. 5); it was,
therefore, not considered for further investigation. Next, we set
out to identify the potential covalent inhibitors among these com-
pounds through tandem mass spectrometry analysis. The tandem
mass spectrometry data show that ebselen, PX-12 and carmofur are
all able to covalently bind to C145 of the catalytic dyad in SARS-CoV-2
Mpro. However, PX-12 and carmofur completely modified Mpro, whereas
ebselen could only partially modify this cysteine of the viral protease
(Extended Data Fig. 6). As ebselen has a stronger inhibitory effect
than the other compounds, there is a possibility that ebselen could
also inhibit Mpro through noncovalent binding. It is likely that a por-
tion of the hits identified by screening are covalently bonded to the
catalytic cysteine of Mpro through their sulfhydryl groups. In general,
such molecules are expected to be promiscuous binders and there-
fore—as they stand—may have limited potential as drug leads. As our
structural data are based on N3, we investigated whether molecular
docking could predict how disulfiram, tideglusib and shikonin bind to

this protein. In all cases, reasonable docking poses were found, which
demonstrates that they could fit inside the substrate-binding pocket
(Extended Data Fig. 7).

Antiviral activity assay
To further substantiate the enzymatic inhibition results in vitro, we
evaluated whether these compounds could prevent viral replication
in cell-based assays. As shown in Fig. 4a, quantitative real-time RT–PCR
(qRT–PCR) demonstrated that, among these compounds, ebselen
and N3 showed the strongest antiviral effects at a concentration of
10 μM treatment in SARS-CoV-2-infected Vero cells. We performed a
plaque-reduction assay (Extended Data Fig. 8) to further assess the
efficacy of these two compounds in protecting cells. Ebselen and N3
displayed inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 with individual half-maximal
effective concentration (EC50) values of 4.67 μM and 16.77 μM, respec-
tively (Fig. 4b, c). The dose–response curves suggest that both of
these compounds may be able to penetrate the cellular membrane
to access their targets. Ebselen is an organoselenium compound with
anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and cytoprotective properties. This
compound has previously been investigated for the treatment of
multiple diseases, including bipolar disorders26 and hearing loss27,28.
Ebselen has extremely low cytotoxicity (the median lethal dose in rats
is >4,600 mg kg−1, when taken orally)29, and its safety in humans has
been evaluated in a number of clinical trials27,28,30. These data strongly
suggest the clinical potential of ebselen for the treatment of coronavi-
ruses. It is also interesting to note that cinanserin displayed moderate
inhibition against SARS-CoV-2 with an EC50 value of 20.61 μM, as shown
from qRT–PCR analysis (Extended Data Fig. 4). This value is superior to
that in the enzymatic inhibition assay, which suggests that cinanserin
might have multidrug targets in preventing viral infection. In further

studies, the selection and characterization of drug-resistant mutants
will help to clarify the mode of action of cinanserin.

## Example 2: Sexual Health Intervention RCT (Prevention Science 2023)

**Paper**: Randomized Trial of a Sexual Health Video Intervention for Black and Hispanic Adolescent Females
**Journal**: Prevention Science
**Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial

Between June 2016 and June 2019, 1770 females were enrolled, with 884 participants randomized to control and 886 assigned to Plan A. The analytic samples for the confirmatory outcome measures vary slightly due to item non-response, with 1700 females in the assessment of LARC use, 1694 females in the assessment of times having sex without condoms, and 1697 females in the assessment of STI testing. The overall attrition for all three confirmatory outcomes is 4%, and the differential attrition is < 1% (Fig. 1).Fig. 1Flow diagram of screening, enrollment, randomization, and follow-up





Baseline characteristics are similar in all samples. Participants were, on average, 19 years old. The majority identified as Hispanic (87%); 14% identified as black. Most had already completed high school (93%) and reported sexual initiation (98%). Approximately 10% of participants were currently using LARC at enrollment, 25% had been tested for STIs in the past 3 months, and were having sex without condoms, on average, 18 times in the past 3 months. Baseline equivalence statistics indicate that treatment and control groups are well balanced on observed characteristics (Table 1).





Findings demonstrate that Plan A has no statistically detectable effect on LARC or condom use for the full sample (Table 2). However, Plan A may be having a meaningful effect on STI testing. Statistical uncertainty remains—the unadjusted treatment effect is significant (p value = 0.038) and the pre-specified covariate-adjusted model is borderline (p value = 0.053). Marginal effects generated from the covariate-adjusted model suggest that the treatment group has a 4.8% greater predicted probability of getting STI tested in the past 3 months than the control group. Three months after the intervention, Plan A participants also have borderline elevated perceptions of HIV/STI risk (p value = 0.057) and may also have a greater probability of getting HIV tested (p value = 0.073).Table 2Findings for confirmatory and exploratory outcomes, by benchmark approach and unadjusted model, three months post-baselineModel 1: Benchmark approachModel 2: UnadjustedVariableEffect estimate (standard error)ap valueMarginal effectbEffect estimate (standard error)ap valueMarginal effectbBehavioral outcomes Current LARC usec0.17 (0.145)0.2300.0220.08 (0.128)0.5120.012 Times having sex without condoms in past 3 monthsc–0.04 (0.063)0.504–0.663–0.08 (0.076)0.296–1.541 STI test in the past 3 monthsc0.19 (0.099)0.0530.0480.20 (0.097)0.0380.050 HIV Test in the past 3 months0.19 (0.105)0.0730.0430.18 (0.101)0.0770.041 Current LARC use (first-time SRH users only)0.53 (0.259)0.0400.0690.56 (0.256)0.0290.074Behavioral antecedents Contraceptive knowledge0.03 (0.007) < 0.0010.0290.04 (0.009) < 0.0010.038 HIV/STI risk perception0.18 (0.093)0.0570.1770.25 (0.110)0.0260.246 Pregnancy risk perception0.07 (0.079)0.3890.0680.10 (0.086)0.2270.104aEffect estimates listed are the coefficients produced by the analytic models.

Effect estimates further indicate that Plan A is having a small but significant effect on contraceptive knowledge among treatment participants (p value < 0.001) and a significant effect on LARC use for first-time SRH users (p value = 0.040). Marginal effects show that for the typical first-time SRH user who was offered Plan A, the estimated probability of using LARC 3 months post-video was 6.9% greater than for a control participant.





Analysis of post-visit questionnaire data suggest that participants who were offered Plan A discussed IUDs, implants, condom use, dual methods of protection, and sexual behavior risks with their healthcare providers at higher rates than participants offered the control condition. Plan A participants also reported experiencing greater discomfort in talking with their healthcare providers about their sexual health and behaviors and reported greater dissatisfaction with their visit (Table 3).Table 3Effect estimates for post-visit questionnaire itemsQuestionnaire itemNEffect estimateaStandard errorMarginal effectDiscussed IUDs16211.20**0.1190.231Discussed implants16210.60**0.1010.149Discussed condoms16210.36**0.1010.088Discussed other birth control16210.080.1020.020Discussed dual methods of protection16210.45**0.1040.105Discussed HIV/STI testing16210.18 * 0.1010.043Discussed sexual behavior risks16210.29**0.1040.067Discussed your sexual behaviors15560.000.1210.001Asked questions/mentioned concerns15600.020.1050.005Comfort level talking with provider about your sexual health1611–0.06**0.028–0.061Comfort level talking with provider about your sexual behaviors1263–0.09**0.036–0.087Satisfaction level with provider1210–0.06**0.029–0.064*indicates P value < 0.10; ** indicates P value < 0.05
