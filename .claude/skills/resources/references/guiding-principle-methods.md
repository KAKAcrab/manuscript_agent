## Example 1: SARS-CoV-2 Drug Discovery (Nature 2020)

**Paper**: Structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of its inhibitors
**Journal**: Nature
**Type**: Original Research Article

No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The

experiments were not randomized and investigators were not blinded

to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment.



Cloning, protein expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro

The full-length gene that encodes SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (NC_045512) was opti-

mized and synthesized for E. coli expression (Genewiz). The cloning strat-

egy for producing authentic viral Mpro has previously been reported10.

The expression plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells

and then cultured in Luria broth medium containing 100 μg/ml

ampicillin at 37 °C. When the cells were grown to an optical density at

600 nm of 0.6–0.8, 0.5 mM IPTG was added to the cell culture to induce

the expression at 16 °C. After 10 h, the cells were collected by centrifuga-

tion at 3,000g. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM

Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl), lysed by high-pressure homogenization,

and then centrifuged at 25,000g for 40 min. The supernatant was loaded

onto Ni-NTA affinity column (Qiagen), and washed in the resuspension

buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. The His-tagged Mpro was eluted by

cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl) including 300 mM

imidazole. Human rhinovirus 3C protease was added to remove

the C-terminal His tag. The Mpro was further purified by ion-exchange

chromatography and size-exclusion chromatography. Coronavirus Mpro

exists as a mixture of monomers and dimers in solution33. The purified

Mpro was stored in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 1 mM EDTA.



Crystallization, data collection and structure determination

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was incubated with 10 mM N3 for 30 min and the

complex (5 mg/ml) was crystallized by hanging drop vapour diffu-

sion method at 20 °C. The best crystals were grown with well buffer

containing 0.1 M MES pH 6.0, 2% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000, 3%

DMSO, 1 mM DTT. The cryo-protectant solution contained 0.1 M MES

pH 6.0, 30% PEG 400.



X-ray data were collected on beamline BL17U1 at Shanghai Synchro-

tron Radiation Facility (SSRF) at 100 K and at a wavelength of 1.07180 Å

using an Eiger X 16M image plate detector. Data integration and scaling

were performed using the program Xia234. The structure was deter-

mined by molecular replacement with the Phaser module35 in CCP436

using the SARS-CoV Mpro (RCSP Protein Data Bank code (PDB) 2H2Z) as

a search template. The output model from molecular replacement was

subsequently subjected to iterative cycles of manual model adjustment

with Coot37 and refinement was finished with Phenix38. The inhibitor

N3 was built according to the omit map. The phasing and refinement

statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1. The Rwork and Rfree

values are 0.202 and 0.235, respectively. There are 97.3% of the residues

in the most favoured regions of the Ramachandran plot, and no residues

are found in disallowed regions.



Enzymatic activity and inhibition assays

The enzyme activity assays have previously been described10. In brief,

the activity of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro was measured by a continuous kinetic

assay, with the substrate Mca–AVLQ↓SGFR-K(Dnp)K (GL Biochem),

using wavelengths of 320 nm and 405 nm for excitation and emis-

sion, respectively. The assay started by immediately mixing 0.2 μM

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with different concentrations of substrate (2.5–100

μM). Fluorescence intensity was monitored with an EnVision multimode

plate reader (Perkin Elmer). Initial rates were obtained by fitting the

linear portion of the curves to a straight line. The kinetic parameters

Km and kcat were calculated from a double-reciprocal plot. As N3 is a

mechanism-based irreversible inhibitor for SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, kobs/[I] was

used as an approximation of the pseudo-second-order rate constant

to evaluate the inhibition effect of the inhibitor N3 (ref. 12). In this case,

the measurement was carried out with 0.2 μM of enzyme, 20 μM of

substrate and inhibitor at 6 different concentrations (0–1 μM).



Virtual screening

The virtual screening was performed using our in-house database via a

workflow application of Glide (v.8.2)22 in Maestro (Schrödinger 2019-1a).

All compounds in the database were considered to be at pH 7.4 ± 0.2

to estimate their protonation state using the program EpiK39. Their

three-dimensional (3D) conformations were generated by the ligPrep

module of Maestro. The structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (PDB 6LU7) was

used to generate the receptor grid for docking simulations. The centre

of the active site of the grid was determined according to the position

of N3 in the structure. The flexibility of the receptor hydroxyl and thiol

groups in side chains of C145, S46 and Y54 were considered. At the very

beginning, we performed a relatively fast but raw screening using the

Glide standard precision model, and the top 20% of compounds were

kept. Finally, the candidate molecules were picked by analysing the

predicted binding modes and their scores.



High-throughput drug screening and IC50 measurement

Potential inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro were screened by an enzy-

matic inhibition assay. When the different compounds were added

into the enzymatic reaction mixture, the change of initial rates was

calculated to evaluate their inhibitory effect. Five drug libraries—

the Approved Drug Library (Target Mol), Clinic Compound Library

(Target Mol), FDA-approved Drug Library (Selleck), Natural Product

Library (Selleck), and Anti-virus Drug Library (Shanghai Institute

for Advanced Immunochemical Studies)—that together comprised

about 10,000 compounds were used. The preliminary screening reac-

tion mixture included 0.2 μM protein, 20 μM substrate and 50 μM

compounds. The compounds of interest were defined as those with

a percentage of inhibition over 60% compared with the reaction in

the absence of inhibitor. IC50 values of 7 drug leads were measured

using 0.2 μM protein, 20 μM substrate and 11 different inhibitor con-

centrations. To exclude inhibitors possibly acting as aggregators, a

detergent-based control was performed by adding 0.001% or 0.01%

freshly made up Triton X-100 to the reaction at the same time25. All

experimental data was analysed using GraphPad Prism. All experi-

ments were performed in triplicate.



Molecular docking

To  understand  the  binding  interaction  of  these  molecules  with

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, two different molecular docking methods (Glide

(v.8.2)22 and iFitDock40) were used to predict their binding poses. Then,

a 3D molecular similarity calculation method, SHAFTS41, was used for

enumeration of the molecular alignment poses by matching the criti-

cal pharmacophore and volumetric overlay between the N3 molecule

within the Mpro structure and the other drug candidates. Then, the

obtained optimal superposition of these molecules was used to assess

the reasonability of the predicted binding poses from the two docking

methods, and only the binding orientations that were consistent among

different methods were kept for constructing the initial complexes.

Finally, these complexes were further optimized and re-scored using

the MM-GBSA module42 of Schrödinger, and the residues within 5 Å

around the ligand were refined.



Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays for compounds from

high-throughput screening

The in vitro antiviral efficacy of the drug candidates on Vero cells was

determined by qRT–PCR. About 1 × 104 Vero cells were seeded into

a 96-well plate and incubated for 20–24 h at 37 °C. All the infection

experiments were performed at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Cells were

pretreated with the drug candidates (10 μM) for 1 h; SARS-CoV-2 (mul-

tiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01) was subsequently added to allow

infection for 2 h. Then, the virus–drug mixture was removed and cells

were further cultured with fresh drug-containing medium. At 72 h

after infection, vRNA was extracted from the culture supernatant



Articleusing QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manu-

facturer’s recommendation, and detected by qRT–PCR assay using

the SARS-CoV-2-specific primers. Because shikonin showed cellu-

lar toxicity at the test concentration, its antiviral activity assay did

not proceed further. vRNA copies per millilitre were determined

using a synthetic RNA fragment to amplify the target region. The

linearized plasmid containing the S gene of SARS-CoV-2 was sub-

jected to in vitro transcription. The resulting RNA transcripts

were purified and then quantified using spectrophotometry on

Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The purified RNA was

diluted tenfold serially using RNase-free water and was detected

using qRT–PCR. Threshold cycle (Ct) values for the known concen-

trations of the RNA were plotted against the log of the number of

genome-equivalent copies. The resultant standard curve was used

to determine the number of genome equivalents of vRNA in the

samples. The determination of the detection limit was based on

the lowest level at which vRNA was detected and remained within

the range of linearity of a standard curve (Ct value of 38). TaqMan

primers for SARS-CoV-2 are 5′-TCCTGGTGATTCTTCTTCAGG-3′

and  5′-TCTGAGAGAGGGTCAAGTGC-3′  with  SARS-CoV-2  probe

5′-FAM-AGCTGCAGCACCAGCTGTCCA-BHQ1-3′. The cytotoxicity

of the tested drugs on Vero cell were determined by MTS cell pro-

liferation assays (Promega). Ten thousand cells were seeded into

a 96-well plate and incubated for 20–24 h at 37 °C. After that, the

medium was removed, and 100 μl of medium containing decreasing

concentrations of antiviral compounds was added to the wells. After

4 days incubation at 37 °C, MTS assays were performed according to

manufacturer’s protocols. All experiments were performed in trip-

licate. Vero cells were obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture

Collection) with authentication service. All cell lines tested negative

for mycoplasma contamination. No commonly misidentified cell

lines were used.



Antiviral and cytotoxicity assays for cinanserin

For the antiviral assay, a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-23 was propagated

in Vero E6 cells, and viral titre was determined as previously described43.

All of the infection experiments were performed at BSL-3. Preseeded

Vero E6 cells (5 × 104 cells per well) were pretreated with the different

concentrations of cinanserin for 1 h and the virus was subsequently

added (MOI of 0.05) to allow infection for 2 h. Then, the virus–drug

mixture was removed and cells were further cultured with fresh

drug-containing medium. At 24 h after infection, the cell supernatant

was collected and vRNA in supernatant was subjected to qRT–PCR

analysis. For cytotoxicity assays, Vero E6 cells were suspended in growth

medium in 96-well plates. The next day, appropriate concentrations

of cinanserin were added to the medium. After 24 h, the relative num-

bers of surviving cells were measured by CCK8 (Beyotime) assay in

accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. All experiments were

performed in triplicate. Vero E6 cells were obtained from ATCC with

authentication service. All cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma

contamination. No commonly misidentified cell lines were used.



Plaque-reduction assays

One hundred thousand Vero E6 cells were seeded in a 24-well plate

and treated with different doses of the inhibitors. All of the infection

experiments were performed at BSL-3. Inhibitors with different dilu-

tion concentrations were mixed with SARS-CoV-2 (100 plaque-forming

units), and 200 μl mixtures were inoculated onto monolayer Vero E6

cells for 1 h. After removing the supernatant, the plate was washed

twice with DMEM medium, cells were incubated with 0.9% agarose

containing appropriate concentrations of inhibitors. The overlay was

discarded at 4 days after infection, and cells were fixed for 30 min in

4% polyoxymethylene and stained with crystal violet working solu-

tion. The plaque-forming units were determined. All experiments were

performed in four biological replicates.



Intact protein analysis

In brief, 2.5 μl of compounds (10 mM in DMSO) was added into 50 μl of

SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (10 mg/ml). The mixtures were kept at room tempera-

ture for 30 min. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses

were performed in positive-ion mode with a quadrupole-time-of-flight

mass spectrometer (Agilent 6550) coupled with a high-performance

liquid chromatograph (HPLC, Agilent 1260) for detecting the molecular

weight of intact proteins. The samples were eluted from a Phenomenex

Jupiter C4 300Å LC column (2 × 150 mm, 5 μm) over a 15-min gradient

from 5% to 100% acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate

of 0.5 ml/min. The acquisition method in positive-ion mode with Dual

Agilent Jet Stream electrospray voltage used a capillary temperature of

250 °C, a fragmentor of 175 V and a capillary voltage of 3,000 V. Mass

deconvolution was performed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative

Analysis B.06.00 software with BioConfirm Workflow.



Tandem mass spectrometry analysis

The samples were precipitated and redissolved by 8 M urea, and then

digested for 16 h at 25 °C by chymotrypsin at an enzyme-to-substrate

ratio of 1:50 (w/w). The digested peptides were desalted and loaded onto

a homemade 30-cm-long pulled-tip analytical column (ReproSil-Pur

C18 AQ 1.9-μm particle size, Dr Maisch, 75-μm inner diameter × 360-μm

outer diameter) connected to an Easy-nLC1200 UHPLC (Thermo Fisher

Scientific) for mass spectrometry analysis. The elution gradient and

mobile phase constitution used for peptide separation were as fol-

lows: 0–1 min, 4–8% B; 1–96 min, 8–35% B; 96–104 min, 35–60% B;

105–120 min, 60–100% B (mobile phase A: 0.1% formic acid in water;

mobile phase B: 0.1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) at a flow rate

of 300 nl/min. Peptides eluted from the liquid chromatography col-

umn were directly electro-sprayed into the mass spectrometer with

the application of a distal 1.8-kV spray voltage. Survey full-scan mass

spectra (from m/z 300–1,800) were acquired in the Orbitrap analyser

(Q Exactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific) with resolution r = 70,000 at

m/z 400. The top 20 tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) events were

sequentially generated and selected from the full mass spectrum at a

30% normalized collision energy. The dynamic exclusion time was set

to 10 s. One acquisition cycle includes one full-scan mas spectrum fol-

lowed by top 20 MS/MS events, sequentially generated on the first to

the twentieth most intense ions selected from the full mass spectrum

at a 28% normalized collision energy. The acquired MS/MS data were

analysed using the UniProtKB E. coli database (database released on

11 November 2016) and SARS-CoV-2 nsp5, using Protein Discoverer

2.1. To accurately estimate peptide probabilities and false-discovery

rates, we used a decoy database containing the reversed sequences of

all the proteins appended to the target database. The false-discovery

rate was set to 0.01. Mass tolerance for precursor ions was set to

20 ppm. Chymotrypsin was defined as cleavage enzyme and the maximal

number of missed cleavage sites was set to four. Protein N terminus

acetylation, methionine oxidation and compounds covalent bindings

were set as variable modifications. The modified peptides were manu-

ally checked and labelled.

Sample size



Sample size estimation was not relevant for this study, as it does not report on a statistical evaluation of effects between two or more groups.



Data exclusions



Samples deemed to be technical failures were excluded. Two data points were verified to be extreme outliers and were therefore removed

when calculating the IC50 values:

Extended Data Fig. 5a (0.0625 μM ebselen with 0.01% Triton X-100, one of the three biological replicates)

Extended Data Fig. 5g (0.390625 μM TDZD-8 with 0.001% Triton X-100, one of the three biological replicates)

Removal of these data points do not alter any conclusions made in this study.



Replication



To ensure reproducibility of experimental findings, each assay was performed at least three times to confirm the results.

IC50 measurements (Fig. 3; Extended Data Fig. 4b; Extended Data Fig. 5) were carried out with three biological replicates for each data point

and these data were used to calculate mean values.

Antiviral activity assays (qRT-PCR, shown in Fig. 4a and Extended Data Fig. 4c) were performed in three biological replicates.

Antiviral activity assays (plaque-reduction assays, shown in Fig. 4b, c and Extended Data Fig. 8) were carried out with four biological replicates.

## Example 2: Sexual Health Intervention RCT (Prevention Science 2023)

**Paper**: Randomized Trial of a Sexual Health Video Intervention for Black and Hispanic Adolescent Females
**Journal**: Prevention Science
**Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial

### Study Design and Setting



The study, an individual-level RCT, was conducted between June 2016 and June 2020 in eight Planned Parenthood (PP) health centers across California: five in California’s San Joaquin Valley and three in the greater Oakland area. These areas experience some of the highest teen birth rates in California (California Department of Public Health, 2015). Health centers were selected that served large populations of Hispanic and/or black adolescents.







### Recruitment, Eligibility Screening, and Enrollment



To be eligible for enrollment, individuals had to meet the following inclusion criteria: self-identify as female; be 18 or 19 years old; self-identify as Hispanic and/or black; be visiting a study health center; be deemed appropriate for the study by PP staff with regard to physical and mental health; indicate that they were not knowingly pregnant nor trying to become pregnant; and not previously enrolled in this or another TPP study. Study coordinators (PP staff) reviewed patient demographic information for upcoming appointments at study health centers and screened all 18- and 19-year-old female patients for eligibility. Only individuals who met the study eligibility criteria and provided informed consent were enrolled. Enrollment continued until the required sample size was reached based on pre-implementation power calculations.







### Randomization and Contrast



Eligible participants were randomly assigned to each condition at a 1:1 ratio prior to receiving the baseline questionnaire. Random assignment was stratified by four administrative regions in blocks of varying sizes using the ralloc command in Stata 14.2. A senior research analyst created and maintained the master randomization list. Participants assigned to treatment were given the opportunity to watch Plan A. Participants assigned to control were given the opportunity to watch a 17-min video about the hazards of cigarettes, which included no SRH content. Questionnaires were administered electronically using SNAP surveys, and videos were screened on Chromebooks that were provided to participants by study coordinators. When the participant clicked the “Submit” button after completing the baseline questionnaire, Plan A or the control video began based on the participant’s randomly assigned condition. Both videos were screened through the Wistia platform, which collected individual-level video dosage data. One of the treatment participants received the control video by mistake, and one of the control participants was not given the opportunity to watch the control video; given that our benchmark approach pre-specified an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, these two individuals were retained in the final impact analysis within their originally assigned condition.







### Data Collection



After randomization, study coordinators administered the baseline questionnaire to participants. The instrument contained 75 items that measured contraceptive knowledge and asked participants to self-report background characteristics, contraceptive use, sexual behaviors and experiences, the belief of risk, and intentions related to sexual behaviors.





After having the opportunity to watch their assigned video, participants went to their scheduled SRH appointment. Immediately after the appointment, they were asked to complete a post-visit questionnaire, which contained seven closed-ended items that asked about topics, behaviors, and questions discussed with the provider during the visit, how comfortable they felt talking about these issues with their provider, and their general satisfaction with the visit.





Three months post-enrollment, research assistants contacted participants to administer follow-up questionnaires. The follow-up questionnaire was almost identical to the baseline questionnaire; it included all 75 questions plus two additional items that asked how and where the participant completed the questionnaire. Follow-up windows opened 3 months after the baseline enrollment date and, once the window opened, participants had 4 months to complete each questionnaire.1 Most participants (86.6%) completed the follow-up questionnaire during the first month of the window. Participants were given a gift card incentive when they completed a questionnaire and responded to requests to update their contact information. All data collection procedures were the same at each follow-up time point and identical for both treatment and control participants. Non-participation or failure to obtain follow-up data was primarily the result of study staff not being able to reach participants after they enrolled in the program.







### Confirmatory and Exploratory Measures



Three confirmatory behavioral outcomes were assessed: LARC use, sex without a condom, and STI testing. Operational definitions for these confirmatory outcomes, all inclusion criteria, and the analytic framework and procedures to estimate the efficacy of plan A were prespecified prior to outcome data collection. LARC use was operationalized as a dichotomous variable; participants were coded as either (1) not currently using or (2) using an intrauterine device (IUD) or implant. Times having sex with no condom in the past 3 months was constructed as a count variable that quantified the number of times a participant reported not using condoms while engaging in any type of sex (vaginal, oral, or anal) over the past 3 months. Participants who reported always using condoms during each sex act or no sex in the past 3 months were coded as zero. STI testing in the past 3 months was constructed as a dichotomous variable where participants were coded as either having been tested for STIs in the past 3 months or not.





Exploratory measures included contraceptive knowledge, HIV/STI risk perception, pregnancy risk perception, HIV testing, and post-visit questionnaire items. Contraceptive knowledge was measured with 10 true or false questions; scores represent the proportion of items to which the participant provided an accurate response. Pregnancy risk perception and HIV/STI risk perception were each assessed with two items using a seven-point semantic-differential scale that asked participants to indicate how likely they thought certain events would happen over the course of a year if they engaged in specific risk behaviors; a low score indicates low perceived likelihood and a high score indicates high likelihood. HIV testing in the past 3 months was constructed identically to the STI testing measure.





Post-visit questionnaire items that asked about topics discussed with the provider during the health visit were used to construct nine binary variables with participants coded as discussed or not discussed. The final three items pertaining to comfort level and satisfaction with the provider were each assessed with one item using a five-point semantic-differential scale; a low score indicates low comfort/satisfaction and a high score indicates high comfort/satisfaction.







### Data Management



Data screening identified invalid, unreliable, outlying, and inconsistent values.2 For each outcome sample, we employed case-wise deletion for any respondent who failed to provide complete responses to all items necessary for the outcome measure; no outcome data were imputed. Baseline equivalence statistics on unimputed background characteristics for each of the three confirmatory outcome measure samples are provided in Table 1. For our impact analysis, missing baseline covariate data were imputed using dummy variable adjustment, where continuous variables missing a value were imputed to the mean for the sample, and dichotomous variables missing a value were imputed to zero. We created indicators to identify records where imputation had been used to address missing baseline values.Table 1Baseline characteristics and equivalence of treatment and control groups, by confirmatory outcome samplesLARC use N = 1700a, bTimes having sex without condoms N = 1694a, cSTI test N = 1697a, dCharacteristicTreatment n = 855Control n = 845Standardized differenceTreatment n = 852Control n = 842Standardized DifferenceTreatment n = 853Control n = 844Standardized differenceMean age (years)19.0419.030.00319.0419.030.00219.0419.030.007Black/African Americane15%13%0.06415%14%0.06315%14%0.065Hispanic/Latinae87%88%–0.05187%88%–0.05187%88%–0.052High school education94%93%0.11494%93%0.10494%93%0.114Sexual initiation98%99%–0.21998%99%–0.21898%99%–0.220Current LARC use9%10%–0.079------Mean times having sex without condoms in the past 3 months---17.519.0–0.044---STI test in the past 3 months------26%24%0.057aSample sizes reported reflect the number of participants in the analytic sample for each outcome (i.e., the number of participants who have a value for the confirmatory outcome measure at the 3-month follow-up). However, the sample sizes do not necessarily indicate the number of participants who provided a response to the baseline characteristic being assessed in this table. For most characteristics, the analytic sample size is equivalent to the sample size reporting a value for the baseline characteristic, but slight variations do exist due to missingness. Statistics in this table reflect non-imputed baseline characteristic valuesbOf the 884 participants randomized to the control condition and 886 participants randomized to the treatment condition, 39 control participants and 31 treatment participants did not provide data at the 3-month follow-up time point for the construction of the LARC use measurecOf the 884 participants randomized to the control condition and 886 participants randomized to the treatment condition, 42 control participants and 34 treatment participants did not provide data at the 3-month follow-up time point for the construction of the times having sex without condoms measuredOf the 884 participants randomized to the control condition and 886 participants randomized to the treatment condition, 40 control participants and 33 treatment participants did not provide data at the 3-month follow-up time point for the construction of the STI test measureeRace and ethnicity were assessed at eligibility screening with the question “What is your race and ethnicity?” Available responses included: White; Black or African American; Hispanic, Latino or Spanish origin; American Indian or Alaska Native; Asian; Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander; Unknown; Some other race/ethnicity (specify). Individuals were allowed to select as many responses as applied to them







### Analysis



Within an ITT framework, we used an available case analysis to identify the average causal effect of being assigned to watch Plan A. Equivalence was assessed using the standardized mean difference of treatment and control groups at baseline for a set of predetermined variables (age, race, ethnicity, education, sexual initiation, and the baseline measure of the outcome). For analytic and interpretive simplicity, we initially prespecified the use of ordinary least squares regression to estimate the average treatment effect for all three confirmatory outcomes (see Analysis Plan registered on clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03238313). However, because some results are sensitive to model choice, we have elected to present results in terms of the negative binomial and logistic regression models that more closely meet the distributional characteristics of the data (Hilbe, 2014). Finally, we converted the treatment coefficients to marginal effects calculated at the mean value for all covariates.





Although a difference of means should produce an unbiased estimate of the effect of Plan A on outcomes, we included the following covariates in the regression equations to improve the efficiency of the estimates: age, black race, Hispanic ethnicity, high school education, and the baseline measure of the outcome variable being estimated. We also included imputation indicators and regional dummy variables to account for blocking. All covariates were mean-centered. All analyses were conducted in Stata 16.1. We conducted sensitivity analyses (Supplementary Material), otherwise employing the benchmark approach, to test whether findings are sensitive to data management and analytic decisions.
