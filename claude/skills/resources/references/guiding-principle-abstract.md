## Example 1: SARS-CoV-2 Drug Discovery (Nature 2020)

**Paper**: Structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of its inhibitors
**Journal**: Nature
**Type**: Original Research Article

A new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the aetiological agent responsible for the 2019–2020 viral pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. Currently, there are
no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of
structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds—including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds—as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.

## Example 2: Sexual Health Intervention RCT (Prevention Science 2023)

**Paper**: Randomized Trial of a Sexual Health Video Intervention for Black and Hispanic Adolescent Females
**Journal**: Prevention Science
**Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial

Despite significant declines, adolescent birth rates in the USA are higher than other industrialized countries, with black and Hispanic youth disproportionately affected. This study assessed the efficacy of a single-session, entertainment-education sexual health video intervention for these populations. Using an individual-level randomized controlled trial, 1770 18- to 19-year-old black and Hispanic females were assigned to watch Plan A (n = 886) or a control video (n = 884) prior to a sexual reproductive health (SRH) visit. Participants self-reported data at baseline and 3 months post-baseline. Within an intent-to-treat framework, we estimated the average causal effect of assignment to Plan A on three confirmatory and five exploratory outcomes. We found that individuals assigned to Plan A had higher contraceptive knowledge, may be more likely to get sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and may have elevated HIV/STI risk perceptions 3 months post-video. Although we found no difference in long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) use nor frequency of condomless sex in the full sample, we did observe that first-time SRH visitors assigned to Plan A had a higher probability of using LARC than those in the control group. This study demonstrates that Plan A is a low-burden, inexpensive, and highly scalable video intervention for black and Hispanic adolescent females that has significant and borderline significant effects on protective sexual health behaviors and important antecedents. It adds to the evidence base of effective teen pregnancy prevention programs and the limited set of rigorous and causal studies investigating the effectiveness of entertainment-education interventions on sexual risk reduction.
