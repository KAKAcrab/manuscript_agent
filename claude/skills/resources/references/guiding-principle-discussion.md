## Example 1: SARS-CoV-2 Drug Discovery (Nature 2020)

**Paper**: Structure of Mpro from SARS-CoV-2 and discovery of its inhibitors
**Journal**: Nature
**Type**: Original Research Article

Our crystal structural and docking data show that the drug leads we
identified can bind to the substrate-binding pocket of SARS-CoV-2
Mpro, which is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. This strongly
supports our hypothesis that the development of a single antiviral
agent targeting Mpro, or such an agent used in combination with other
potential therapies, could provide an effective first line of defence
against all diseases associated with coronaviruses.

In the last 20 years, new infectious agents—such as SARS and MERS—
have emerged and caused epidemics7. The timely development of effec-
tive antiviral agents for clinical use is extremely challenging, because
conventional drug development approaches normally take years of
investigation and cost billions of dollars. The repurposing of approved
pharmaceutical drugs and drug candidates provides an alternative
approach that allows for the rapid identification of potential drug
leads to manage rapidly emerging viral infections. Cell-based pheno-
typic screening has proven to be valuable31, but the complexity of this
approach is not readily compatible with high-throughput pipelines,
and it cannot identify the molecular target or mechanism of action32.
In this study, the convergence of structure-based ab initio drug design,
virtual screening and high-throughput screening proved to be an effi-
cient strategy to find antiviral leads against SARS-CoV-2. The methods
presented here can greatly assist in the rapid discovery of drug leads
with clinical potential in response to new emerging infectious diseases
that currently lack specific drugs and vaccines.

## Example 2: Sexual Health Intervention RCT (Prevention Science 2023)

**Paper**: Randomized Trial of a Sexual Health Video Intervention for Black and Hispanic Adolescent Females
**Journal**: Prevention Science
**Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial

Causal estimates produced from this RCT provide evidence that Plan A is a promising, low-burden, brief SRH EE video intervention for black and Hispanic female adolescents who are about to receive SRH care, which may have favorable effects on protective sexual health behaviors and theoretically important antecedents in these at-risk and underserved populations. The strengths of this study are its methodological rigor—a randomized design, with a high follow-up rate (96%), low differential attrition (< 1%), and benchmark inferences that are stable across a battery of sensitivity tests and racial/ethnic subgroups. Baseline equivalence analysis further attests that randomization appears to be well implemented.

Results demonstrate that watching Plan A prior to a SRH health visit leads to increased STI testing for black and Hispanic female adolescents. Convention suggests that with a test statistic of 1.91 (p value = 0.053), the null hypothesis should be interpreted as true and the inference should be that the intervention is having zero effect on the outcome. This is an overzealous interpretation of what hypothesis tests can do in general (Wasserstein & Lazar, 2016), and in this case, we believe it to be an oversimplification of what the data are telling us. Statistical tests for this outcome are substantively sensitive to model specifications (Table 2; Supplementary Material—Table S2), and closely related outcomes (HIV testing) and their antecedents (STI/HIV risk perception) all demonstrate patterns that are consistent with meaningful STI testing increases. Taken together and consistent with the intervention’s theory of change, the evidence suggests that people who view Plan A before a health visit are more likely to experience elevated perceptions of their risk for STIs and HIV and this in turn motivates them to get tested. While we cannot rule out that the effect is zero (given statistical uncertainty), this is the first and only experiment of the efficacy of Plan A and the 4.8% increase in the probability of getting tested is our best estimate of the average treatment effect (Gerber & Green, 2012). If this is accurate, the effect is modest (Cox index = .117), but when we consider the negligible burden of Plan A, the effect is noteworthy because it comes at virtually no cost to staff or the clinic. Further research, perhaps with an even larger or more targeted sample, is warranted.

Findings also indicate that Plan A appears to be imparting important SRH information, leading to a significant increase in viewers’ contraceptive knowledge 3 months after watching the video. Although no significant effects were observed in LARC use and condom use consistency within the full sample, a subgroup analysis indicates that Plan A was effective in motivating LARC uptake among black and Hispanic females receiving SRH care for the first time (n = 480). This aligns with literature that contends that prior risk behaviors can constrain future SRH behavior (Demaria et al., 2019; Fekadu & Kraft, 2001). If these theories are accurate, then the video may be especially persuasive for new initiates of SRH care because they may be more likely to be open to its influential message. An array of empirical work in communication and psychology finds that those who are uninitiated, uninformed, or disengaged with an object (in this case, LARC) will tend not to have formed coherent, strong, or even accessible beliefs about that object (Azjen & Sexton, 1999; Crocker et al., 1984; Hastie & Dawes, 2009; Higgins, 1996). Entertaining scenarios provided by EE may simply provide sufficient motivation to begin attending to, processing the persuasive messages, and forming supportive attitudes, beliefs, and opinions. Another line of thinking suggests that new initiates may have avoided SRH not because it was unimportant to them, but because of fear elicited by misinformation (Payne et al., 2016; Potter et al., 2014). In any case, data suggest that SRH visits are an opportune time for an EE intervention to reduce the risk for first-time clients. For this group, one 23-minute video was enough to significantly improve contraceptive knowledge and increase LARC uptake 3 months later. The question of how and why it does so is empirical and worth further investigation.

Analysis of feedback collected immediately after the SRH visit provides evidence that Plan A may also be motivating the sort of interactions hypothesized by the intervention’s theory of change, though with some predictable but perhaps unanticipated consequences. Participants assigned to Plan A report that they discuss important sexual health topics with their providers at higher rates than participants in the control group. At the same time, these participants are also reporting greater (though modest) discomfort with these discussions (Hedge’s g for comfort talking with a provider about sexual health = −0.109; Hedge’s g for comfort talking with a provider about sexual behaviors = −0.136). One interpretation of these findings is that participants assigned to the Plan A video are having relatively more SRH discussions with their healthcare providers and, because these discussions may be uncomfortable for some, these respondents are reporting relatively more (but small in magnitude) discomfort on average. The video, in other words, maybe motivating patients to have discussions with their providers, but it does little to help them feel more comfortable about these discussions. This is, of course, merely conjecture at this point, as the data we have collected do not permit an empirical answer to why Plan A participants report greater discomfort than those who did not see the video. Mixed methods may be best suited to explore participant and healthcare provider perspectives on the interactions that follow (viewing of) the video.

This study is limited in its scope. We have examined the efficacy of Plan A for specific populations (black and Hispanic female adolescents) within a limited geographic location (mid-California) for a particular period of time (3 months post-baseline). This sort of specification is necessary when one aims to rigorously study program impacts with finite resources. Future research could broaden this scope where it makes sense; in particular, we recommend that the long-term efficacy of the intervention be evaluated, with a specific investigation of participants’ continued engagement in SRH care after watching the video. Generalizability may also be limited by the setting of the intervention. Both Plan A and control participants received the same high standard of care (SOC) at Planned Parenthood. During the study period, participants attended one or more provider visits where the SOC included discussing their sexual health and covered a range of effective contraceptive methods. Future studies could investigate whether Plan A has a stronger impact in environments where young women do not receive the same intensity and/or quality of sexual health information, such as general health clinics, community organizations, or schools. Another limitation of the study is its reliance on self-reported data, which may not necessarily reflect actual behaviors and can lack precision and accuracy.
