## Example 2: Sexual Health Intervention RCT (Prevention Science 2023)

**Paper**: Randomized Trial of a Sexual Health Video Intervention for Black and Hispanic Adolescent Females
**Journal**: Prevention Science
**Type**: Randomized Controlled Trial

The adolescent birth rate in the USA remains higher than in most industrialized nations, especially in some racial and ethnic groups (Sedgh et al., 2015). In 2020, the birth rates for Hispanic and non-Hispanic black teens were 24.4 and 23.5 per 1000 females aged 15–19, respectively, more than twice that of non-Hispanic white teens (Osterman et al., 2022). Since 2009, health officials have prioritized the development of successful teen pregnancy prevention (TPP) strategies and funded an evidence review to identify effective TPP programs (Goesling et al., 2014). However, most of the TPP programs included were time- and resource-intensive (Mathematica Policy Research, 2016). Additionally, programs targeted younger teens, although 76% of teen births occur in 18- and 19-year-old females (Osterman et al., 2022). To address these gaps, the Office of Adolescent Health (OAH) (now the Office of Population Affairs) funded a round of research in 2015 to identify and study new programs.





Entertainment education (EE), which is a theory-based communication strategy that leverages the power of storytelling for health promotion and behavior change, has emerged as one promising but under-evaluated strategy (Singhal et al., 2013). A number of sexual and reproductive health (SRH) EE interventions have shown favorable effects on family planning (Rogers et al., 1999; Vaughan et al., 2000), sexual behaviors (Jones et al., 2013; Neumann et al., 2011; O’Donnell et al., 1995; Orozco-Olvera et al., 2019), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and care (Fisher et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2019; Neumann et al., 2018), sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and acquisition (Downs et al., 2018; Neumann et al., 2011; Warner et al., 2008), and important antecedents to these behaviors (Wang & Singhal, 2016). Safe in the City, VOICES/VOCES, and Taking Care of Me are all single-session video interventions with some evidence of the potential effectiveness of the videos on targeted sexual health behaviors and outcomes (Harshbarger et al., 2012; Neumann et al., 2011, 2018; O’Donnell et al., 1995; Warner et al., 2008). However, the evidence base of SRH EE interventions is limited by the quality and rigor of the research conducted (Orozco-Olvera et al., 2019). Only a few evaluations have assessed low-burden SRH EE interventions using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (Downs et al., 2018; Jones et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2019; O’Donnell et al., 1995; Warner et al., 2008).







### Purpose



This article presents findings from the RCT that assessed the efficacy of a low-burden, scalable 23-min SRH EE video intervention known as Plan A (www.myplana.org). The video was developed in 2016 with OAH funding to promote effective contraceptive use, the use of dual methods of protection, and HIV/STI testing. Through a series of three inter-related, soap opera-style vignettes, five primary topics are addressed in the video: (1) pregnancy, STI, and HIV risk perception; (2) contraceptive options, with an emphasis on long-acting reversible contraception (LARC); (3) condom use and partner negotiation skills; (4) importance of regular HIV/STI testing; and (5) comfort discussing sexual history, HIV/STI testing, and contraceptive methods with a health provider. Between each vignette, there is a short, animated sequence to deliver information about intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the implant (Plant et al., 2019). All content included in the video went through a medical accuracy review process to confirm the information presented was factually accurate and up-to-date.





Plan A was developed specifically for Hispanic and black female adolescents to promote equitable access to SRH information and reduce disparities in adolescent sexual health risk and birth rates across these racial and ethnic groups. The main characters featured in the film all identify as either black and/or Hispanic. The video is intended to be shown immediately before an appointment with a SRH provider and aims to motivate behavior change. It provides facts about contraceptive and sexual protection options to create awareness, demonstrates risk reduction strategies for unwanted pregnancy and HIV/STIs, and models effective communication with sexual partners and SRH providers. Plan A was built upon previous health EE videos, which have some evidence of motivating positive behavior change (Neumann et al., 2018) and reducing incident STIs (Harshbarger et al., 2012; Warner et al., 2008). Plan A is grounded in the extended elaboration likelihood model (E-ELM) and social cognitive theory (SCT) (Bandura, 2004; Slater & Rouner, 2002).





SCT posits that people learn, can be motivated to change, and develop a belief about their ability to change, by observing others (Bandura, 2004). The developers of the Plan A video hypothesize that viewers learn by watching characters make contraceptive and sexual protection choices and experience the consequences of those decisions vicariously. In this way, viewers’ outcome expectations may be influenced and result in behavior change. The E-ELM is a dual-process model that explains how different types of persuasive messages may be processed, depending on the nature of the message (Petty & Cacioppo, 1986; Slater & Rouner, 2002). As it relates to entertainment education, the model postulates that viewers who are engaged and entertained will be less inclined to counter-argue with persuasive messages. The developers expect that Plan A’s pro-health messages and values will appeal to viewers in part because of the video’s high production value. They also expect viewers to process these messages peripherally and favorably because they are subsumed within a dramatic and engaging storyline, and conveyed by relatable, sympathetic, and identifiable characters. According to E-ELM, character identification is a key facilitator of increased absorption and acceptance.





Confirmatory research questions of the RCT asked whether the offer to view Plan A differentially impacted treatment participants’ use of LARC, frequency of condomless sex, and receipt of STI testing 3 months after being assigned to watch the video as compared to control participants and were prespecified in a statistical analysis plan registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Exploratory research questions asked whether the offer to watch Plan A impacted participants’ contraceptive knowledge, pregnancy and HIV/STI risk perception, and HIV/STI testing. Each of these outcomes was investigated because they are central to the intervention’s theory of change and are salient in the video content. The video incorporates medically accurate contraceptive information as part of the dialogue in the narrative (knowledge). Plan A also emphasizes the importance of both routine STI and HIV testing and dramatizes the risks associated with unprotected sex (risk perceptions and testing behavior). We also investigated the impact of Plan A on LARC use for first-time SRH users because the developer of Plan A was particularly interested in this outcome for this group, and evidence suggests that contraceptive use behaviors are persistent and may be more resistant to change than other SRH decisions (Demaria et al., 2019; Fekadu & Kraft, 2001). First-time SRH clinic visitors may be more responsive to persuasive change messages (i.e., LARC uptake) because their behaviors are not yet habituated. Finally, to better understand the immediate effect of the video on the SRH visit occurring directly after viewing, we evaluated data provided by participants about the content of their discussion with the provider and their comfort and satisfaction with the visit.
